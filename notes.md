performance testing:
evaluate component performance
no heavy load
tuning

do not aim to finc defects
establish the benchmark behaviour

load testing:
* feed the system the largest task it can handle
* increase the load
* simulate virtual users

* expose defects
* determine the upper limit fir all components

Stress testing:
* attempt to break the system down
* overhelm its ressources
" take resources away

* graceful failure and recovery
* define application behaviour after failure
